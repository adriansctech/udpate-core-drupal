# Update Drupal Core automatically
## This script will update the core of drupal to the version that we indicate. It is done to have it in the root folder where we have all our drupal projects created with [Docker-Lamp](https://github.com/carlosreig/docker-lamp). At the end of the script we will see a warning indicating that we can now run update.php on our site.
